1. I have just completed the Shoe Catalogue Api.

2. I used my existing knowledge of javascript html and css as well as my knowledge of the postgres sql database and its queries. I made use of the semantic ui frame work for my front end and handlebars for templating. 

3.I used my existing knowledge of javascript html and css as well as my knowledge of the postgres sql database and its queries. I made use of the semantic ui frame work for my front end and handlebars for templating. I used express for my server and body parser middleware to parse the body of my html.

4.The main objective of this project was to create an api out of my shoe catalogue project and I learn't how to do that with this project. I also learn't how to use axios to fetch my routes as well as how to test them using super-test. I also separated my files this time around so that my factory function, api services and shoe routes were all separate in files.

5.I found this project quiet challenging at first  in terms of trying to understand what api's where and what their function was. I found it quite complicated adding another layer in between the client side and server side to send and get data between the two. To be honest I am still getting my head around it but I have a fairly good understanding of api's now. Testing the routes was also very challenging.

6.I learn't how to build a simple API to send and get data passing it between the server and client side of my shoe catalogue project. I also learnt how to separate my files into routes and services and clean up my code to make it more organised. I also learnt to test the routes of the api.
